Have a look at file client.py.
$ cat client.py

In this file a function receive() is defined. Find where that function is mentioned in .py files.
  i. Show only files containing matches
     $ grep -H "def receive():" *.py
 ii. Show occurrences with line number
     $ grep -Hn "def receive():" *.py

Look at a .csv file to see what it looks like.
  i. Print the first 3 lines of each csv file.
     $ head -n 3 *.csv
 ii. Print the last couple of lines of each csv file.
     $ tail -n 2 *.csv # you *did* say couple

Do some of the .csv files contain the words foo or bar (in any capitalization)?
$ grep -ie "foo\|bar" *.csv # only mailing_results_4
