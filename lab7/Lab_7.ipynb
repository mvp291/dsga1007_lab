    "Remember last class when we were talking abour **software structure**? Today we will review the details of what building blocks there are to create **structure** in our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed last week too, when you're designing software for the *long run* you want to make it **Maintainable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also other aspects involving *the people who actually use the code*, let's call them *the client*. You want *the client* to be happy, so once you give him/her a solution to their problem, you don't want to create more problems for him/her. In particular, once you committed with a particular *way of doing things* or a particular communication *interface* with *the client* you should try not to break it. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notion is called [**backward compatibility**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility). \n",

    "From the \"Learning Python Book\":\n",
    "> The **highest-level program organization unit**, which packages program code and data for **reuse**, and provides self-contained namespaces that minimize variable name clashes across your programs.\n",
    "As we’ve seen, Python programs are composed of **multiple module files linked together by import statements**, and each module file is **a package of variables**—that is, a namespace. Just as importantly, each module is a self-contained namespace: **one module file cannot see the names defined in another file unless it explicitly imports that other file**. Because of this, modules serve to minimize name collisions in your code—because each file is a self-contained namespace, the names in one file cannot clash with those in another, even if they are spelled the same way. \n",
    "\n",

    "To use a specific module inside your Python *script*, you need to import that module. \n",

    "``` \n",
    "import <module> as <md> # client fetches a module (module_name) as a whole\n",

    "From the Learning Python Book:\n",
    "> In addition to a module name, an import can name a directory path. A directory of Python code is said to be a package, so such imports are known as package imports. In effect, a package import turns a directory on your computer into another Python name- space, with attributes corresponding to the subdirectories and module files that the directory contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Package \\_\\_init\\_\\_.py Files\n",
    "From the Learning Python Book:\n",
    "> If you choose to use package imports, there is one more constraint you must follow: at least until Python 3.3, each directory named within the path of a package import state- ment must contain a file named __init__.py, or your package imports will fail.\n",
    "> The __init__.py files can contain Python code, just like normal module files. Their names are special because their code is run automatically the first time a Python pro- gram imports a directory, and thus serves primarily as a hook for performing initiali- zation steps required by the package. These files can also be completely empty, though, and sometimes have additional roles.\n",

You can get plenty of work done with simpler constructs such as functions, or even simple top-level script code. Because using classes well requires some up-front planning, they tend to be of more interest to people who work in strategic mode (doing long-term product development) than to people who work in tactical mode (where time is in very short supply).\n",
